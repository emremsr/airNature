        Once upon a time, once upon a time, it was snowing on the ground in one of the cities on a winter day. It's very
        cold. People were looking for places to warm up quickly. In such a weather, snowflakes were slowly drifting down
        to the ground.

        As a tiny but very sweet snowflake fell to the ground, the cloud called out to him: “Hey Snowflake, good luck on
        your way. Say hi for me to the lands you will go to. I wish you to fall into a beautiful place.” said.

        Snowflake replied, “Of course, I'm dying to fall in the most beautiful place. I'm going to land in a beautiful
        place. I will convey your greetings.” Then the snowflake fell to the ground. Different snowflakes were falling
        in different places around him.

        Some of them fell on the tops of the mountains and remained as snowflakes, watching the surroundings. Some
        snowflakes fell into the sea and turned into water drops, watching the incoming and outgoing ships. Some
        snowflakes poured into the city and mixed with drinking water.

        Our little snowflake couldn't decide where to land. If I fall on the mountain, I will always stay there, I get
        bored, he said. He said it would be nice if I fell into the sea, but I can land in better places. It was last
        thought of.

        Yes, our little snowflake has made up his mind. It was obvious where he was going. It would fall into the palm
        of a child. He wanted to make the child happy by falling into his hand. He adjusted the landing spot
        accordingly.
